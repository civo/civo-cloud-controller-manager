# e2e Tests

e2e tests for the Civo Cloud Controller Manager.

These tests can be run:

```bash
CIVO_API_KEY=.... go test --timeout 30 -v ./e2e/...
```

or the CIVO_API_KEY can be set in the `.env` file in the root of the project

## PreRequisites

A civo.com account is needed, and you'll need to get your API key from the web front end.

## Tests

The general flow for each test is as follows:

1. Provision a new cluster
2. Wait for the cluster to be provisioned
2. Scale down pre-deployed CCM in the cluster
4. Run the local copy of CCM 
5. Run e2e Tests
6. Delete the cluster
